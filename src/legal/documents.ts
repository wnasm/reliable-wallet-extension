In addition, the Reliable Wallet Services consist of developer kits to add to add wallet connection to third-party dapps. Some of the dapps accessible using the Reliable Wallet Services may also involve accessing certain cryptocurrency markets, boards, or interfaces allowing for complex financial transactions. IMPORTANT:  Reliable provides all information “as is” and you may not redistribute information displayed on or provided by the Reliable Wallet Services.

1.2 Offerings and Access

When you request to make a transfer of cryptocurrency, in order to initiate such a transfer using the Reliable Wallet Services, you will be required to initiate or “sign” a transfer. Reliable is entitled to rely on the transfer initiation or signature and has no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity or accuracy of any transfer initiated by you.

1.3 Market and Third-Party Date

By using the Reliable Wallet Services you may view information pertaining to third party cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency wallets, staking pools, and liquidity pools. The presentation of this information does not imply any association with or endorsement of third parties, even if certain functionalities provided in connection with the Reliable Wallet Services require the use of such third party products. The content of such third party services and products as stated via the Reliable Wallet Services is based on information made publicly available or by such third parties to us, and we therefore make no representations or warranties on the accuracy of such third-party service or product related information.

1.4 Third Party Payment Services

The Reliable Wallet Services provides users links to third party processors to process any fiat purchases of cryptocurrencies. When you purchase cryptocurrencies with fiat currencies through these links, you are purchasing cryptocurrencies directly from the third party provider using Apple Pay or a valid bank account using your debit cards.Your purchase must follow the relevant instructions provided through the Reliable-Ethereum Wallet mobile application and terms and conditions of the third party provider.

2. The Reliable Wallet

2.1 Non-Custodial

The Reliable Wallet is an unhosted and non-custodial wallet for holding supported cryptocurrencies. You control the cryptocurrencies held in the Reliable Wallet. With Reliable Wallet, the private keys (which represent the password to access the cryptocurrency) are stored directly on your device. At any time, subject to having internet access and the congestion on the blockchain, you may withdraw your cryptocurrency by sending it to a different blockchain address. When holding your cryptocurrencies in Reliable Wallet, Reliable does not maintain control over your Reliable  Wallet, cryptocurrencies or private keys. Users are responsible for the risk of loss of their private keys and seed phrases and neither Reliable Wallet nor Reliable may not recover such keys or seed phrases.

2.2 Recovery Phrase

When you create a new wallet using Reliable Wallet, Reliable Wallet generates a 12-word recovery phrase, known as a “seed phrase”' or “secret phrase”, that you and only you have access to. This means that if you lose your recovery phrase, you will lose access to your Reliable Wallet and any cryptocurrencies therein. Please keep in mind that Reliable will never have access to this recovery phrase, so we cannot move funds on your behalf nor can we help you access cryptocurrencies in your Reliable Wallet should you lose your recovery phrase. As an added safeguard, Reliable has built an encrypted iCloud feature so you can back-up your recovery phrase. We encourage you to back up your recovery phrase using this feature, as well as writing it down and storing it in a secure location. To access the backup feature, tap Settings then Recovery Phrase from your Reliable Wallet mobile application.

2.3 Supported Cryptocurrencies

The Reliable Wallet supports all ERC-20 tokens. To see all the supported cryptocurrencies, you can store and transfer on Reliable Wallet, open the mobile app and tap Receive or “Discover” and “Get”. Use the search bar to see if a specific cryptocurrency is supported. When you connect you use your Reliable Wallet to exchange cryptocurrencies you are interacting with a decentralized exchange to buy or transfer supported cryptocurrencies directly from your Reliable Wallet. Certain ERC-20 tokens may be not supported from time to time, which will restrict your ability to purchase or sell ERC-20 tokens.

2.4 Peer-to-Peer Transactions

The Reliable Wallet Services enable you to send supported cryptocurrencies to, and request, receive, and store supported cryptocurrencies from, third parties by giving instructions through the Site. Your transfer of supported cryptocurrencies between your other cryptocurrency wallets and to and from third parties is a transfer. When you or a third party sends cryptocurrencies to your Reliable Wallet address, the person initiating the transaction is solely responsible for executing the transaction properly, which may include, among other things, payment of sufficient network or miner’s fees in order for the transaction to be successful. Insufficient network fees may cause a transfer to remain in a pending state and may result in delays or loss incurred as a result of an error in the initiation of the transaction. Reliable has no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions. When you send cryptocurrency from your Reliable Wallet to another cryptocurrency wallet, such transfers are executed on chain by you and not under the control of the Reliable. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting them. Reliable shall bear no liability or responsibility in the event you enter an incorrect blockchain destination address.

Cryptocurrency transfers cannot be reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant cryptocurrency network, although they may be in a pending state, and designated accordingly, while the transaction is processed by network operators. Reliable does not control the network and makes no guarantees that a transfer will be confirmed by the network.

3. Fees and Taxes

By using the Reliable Wallet Services, you agree to pay all applicable fees, including transaction fees for cryptocurrency swaps, card or bank transfers. Bank fees, credit card and debit card fees charged for any cryptocurrency purchases may be netted out of the settled amount of your cryptocurrency purchases using Apple Pay or a debit card. You are responsible for paying any additional fees charged by your financial service provider. You will also incur a network and/or gas fee, which is the fee incurred when a user buys BTC, ETH and ERC20 tokens or “native gas” fee. It is charged by and paid to the blockchain network for facilitating the transaction, not Reliable. It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transaction via the  Reliable Wallet Services, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amount of tax to the appropriate tax authorities. All fees payable by you are exclusive taxes unless otherwise noted. Reliable reserve the right to withhold taxes where required.
